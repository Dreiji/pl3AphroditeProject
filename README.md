****PACMAN: Payroll Automation and Calculation Management Application Network****

**To create an automatic payroll for employees that automatically deducts taxes such as Pag-Ibig

specific code wherein if one inputs the salary of a specific employee, the company does not have
to compute it manually. Additionally, tax deductions are a critical part of any payroll system, and
they must be accurately calculated and deducted. This proposal outlines an automatic payroll
system with tax deductions for your organization.**
